# Firebase Studio

This is a NextJS starter in Firebase Studio.

## Getting Started

To get started, take a look at `src/app/page.tsx`.

## Setup AI Functionality

This project uses Google's Gemini model via Genkit for its AI features. To enable them, you must provide a Gemini API key.

1.  Create a free API key in [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey).
2.  Open the `.env` file in the root of this project.
3.  Replace `"YOUR_API_KEY_HERE"` with the key you just created.

The application will now be able to connect to the AI service.
